# Erratum for "An Empirical Evalution of Explanations for State Repression"

We gained 33 observations in the newer version of the data. Below are the observations that are in the new data but not in the old.

```{r, erratum, tidy=TRUE}
df <- read.csv("./data/rep.csv")
non_original <- c("terrrev", "laworder", "cim", "CIE", "lagus", "lagun", "hrordinal", "nonhrordinal")
df <- df[!is.na(df$physint) & !is.na(df$amnesty), !(colnames(df) %in% non_original)]

df_old <- read.csv("./data/rep_published.csv")
df_old <- df_old[!is.na(df_old$physint) & !is.na(df_old$amnesty), ]

library(dplyr, quiet = TRUE)

diff_old_new <- anti_join(df, df_old, by = c("ccode", "year"))
diff_old_new$cname <- countrycode(diff_old_new$ccode, "cown", "country.name", TRUE)
diff_old_new[, c("cname", "ccode", "year")]
```
This was caused by a combination of issues with the script that cleaned and merged the source data for the published verison of the article. The old scripts can be viewed [here](https://github.com/zmjones/eeesr/releases/tag/1). The old data is available on request.
